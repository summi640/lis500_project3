			<h3>About this Site</h3>
			<p>This site is used to showcase our learnings while taking LIS500: Code and Power!
			Throughout this site, you can learn more about us, a little bit about what we
			learned throughout the course, and about some pretty neat people in the Tech world.</p>
			<p>LIS500 helps us learn to analyze and critique the portrayal of race, gender and 
			computing in various media outlets. We also learn to  consider our potential as 
			contributors to the computing industries in light of media portrayals and our
			own self-perception. </p>

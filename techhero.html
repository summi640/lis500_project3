			<p>Dr. Mark Dean is a prominent figure in the world of computers, he is an inventor and computer engineer. He is most known for his contributions at IBM on the invention of the Personal Computer (PC), he holds three out of nine IBM patents on the PC. Him and his co-creator, Dennis Moeller, paved the way 
				in Information Technology by allowing the use of plug-in subsystems and peripherals like disk drives, video gear, speakers, and scanners. In addition to his work on the PC, he also lead a design team that produced the 1-Gigahertz chip, an invention with limitless potential. Eventually, Dr. Mark Dean joined the faculty of the College 
				of Engineering at his alma mater, the Univeristy of Tennessee. He is now retired and currently holds over 40 patents for his work.</p>
		
			<p>His time working in the computer industry helped set precedent for African American people following in his footsteps. In 1995, Mark became the first African American to be named an IBM Fellow.</p>

		<p> "I just have my own attitude. I’m out here to get the job done, and I knew I had the ability to do it, and that’s where my focus was." <b>-Annie Easley </b></p>
		<h3>About Her Work</h3>
	   
			<p>Annie Easley was a pioneering African American computer scientist, mathematician, and rocket scientist who made significant contributions to NASA's space programs. She worked at the Lewis Research Center (now NASA Glenn Research Center), where she developed software for energy conversion systems and rocket propulsion technologies. Easley was instrumental in advancing the Centaur rocket project, a high-energy rocket essential for launching space probes. In addition to her technical work, she advocated for diversity and inclusion in STEM fields, inspiring future generations of women and minorities to pursue careers in science and engineering. 
			</p>
			<p>Easley began her career as a “human computer,” doing computations for researchers. This involved analyzing problems and doing calculations by hand. Her earliest work involved running simulations for the newly planned Plum Brook Reactor Facility. When hired, she was one of only four African-American employees at the Lab. Easley retired in 1989, but she remained an active participant in the Speaker’s Bureau and the Business & Professional Women’s Association. Annie Easley passed away on June 25, 2011.

				<h3>Anna B</h3>
				<img src="images/annapic.jpg" alt="Anna Picture">
				<p>Hello! My name is Anna Burson and I am a Junior at UW-Madison double majoring in Information 
				Science and Data Science, pursuing an additional certificate in Digital Studies. In my free 
				time I enjoy reading, running, and I have just gotten into knitting! Beyond the normal “tech things”, I really 
				enjoy a good spreadsheet, they always seem to keep me organized.</p>

				<h3>Asma S</h3>
				<img src="images/asma's.JPG" alt="Asma Picture">
				<p>My name is Asma Sulieman and I am a senior majoring in Information Science with a minor in digital Studies. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my loved ones. I also enjoy running/working out. I am trying to get into sewing and knitting. I would say as I've taken many LIS courses I've seen my passion grow towards more of the UX/UI field that now anytime I am using a new app or interacting with a technology device I see myself using the UX/UI critical framework.</p>

				<h3>Janet S</h3>
				<img src="images/janetpic.jpg" alt="Janet Picture">
				<p>My name is Janet Seidl and I am a junior. I am pursuing a degree in Information Science 
				with certificates in Computer Science and Data Science. In my free time, I enjoy reading,
				spending time outside while the weather is nice, and hanging out with my friends/housemates.
				While there have been a lot of cool "tech things" created within the last couple of decades,
				the Wii will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>

			<h1>Why LIS500?</h1>
			<h3>Anna</h3>
			<p>I am taking this course one, because it is a requirement for my Information Science degree and two, because I think the intersection of technology and society is an interesting phenomenon that will inherently be present in my future career.</p>
			<h3>Asma</h3>
			<p>I am taking this class as a requirement for my Information Science major. I've also had a growing passion for UX/UI and learning more about the creation of human-centered techologies and how as our society changes and these innovations and their impacts or hidden biases continue to feed into societal social constructs.</p>
			<h3>Janet</h3>
			<p>I am taking this course because it fufills some requirements for my degree and certificates,
			but also because I thought the topic seemed neat. I took a previous class that talked a bit
			about biases within technology and the affects it can have on society. I enjoyed learning about	the topic 
			and this class seemed like a good way to dive a little deeper into it.</p>
